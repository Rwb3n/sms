| **1. Context & Background**    | - Pokémon Centre Japan restricts shipments & lottery entries to Japanese addresses/phone numbers.<br>- Reshippers (Tenso, Blackship) handle shipping but not phone verification.<br>- Lottery entry now requires SMS verification to a Japanese mobile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **2. Core Objective**          | Obtain a verifiable Japanese mobile number capable of receiving SMS codes from Pokémon Centre Japan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **3. Constraints**             | - Must satisfy Japan’s telecommunications regulations (carrier rules, prefix requirements).<br>- Avoid violations of terms of service.<br>- Budget considerations (e.g. £45–\$45 services, SIM purchase costs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **4. Key Sub-problems**        | a. Acquisition of a Japanese-capable phone number (physical SIM vs. eSIM vs. virtual).<br>b. Registration of that number under a recognized subscriber identity (e.g. resident, visa holder).<br>c. SMS reception reliability for verification codes.<br>d. Interaction with Pokémon Centre site (sessions, CAPTCHA, geo-checks).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **5. Existing Approaches**     | - Third-party services charging \~£45 to perform verification.<br>- Reddit users offering to pass codes.<br>- Virtual SMS platforms (“Get SMS Codes”) partnering with Japanese carriers.<br>- Purchasing prepaid SIM in Japan (requires ID/visa).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **6. Open Questions & Risks**  | - Are virtual/online SMS services truly compliant and reliable?<br>- Could physical SIM be obtained remotely (e.g. via family/friend)?<br>- What happens if a number is shared by multiple users (blacklist risk)?<br>- Legal/compliance risk if Japanese law forbids non-residents from certain SIM types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **7. Possible Solution Paths** | 1. **Physical SIM via Proxy**: Ship a prepaid Japanese SIM to a friend/reshipper in Japan who registers it, then forward it.<br>2. **Virtual Japanese Mobile Service**: Use a reputable provider offering dedicated Japanese numbers, confirmed to work for 2FA.<br>3. **Local Purchase on Visit**: If you travel, buy and register a SIM in person.<br>4. **Authorized Verification Service**: Vet the £45 services—ensure they log into your account only for the SMS step.<br>5. **Telco Partner Approach**: Find a domestic carrier with Japanese roaming/MVNO ties. |
| **8. Next Steps**              | - Answer clarifying questions.<br>- Research Japanese SIM registration rules (prefixes, ID requirements).<br>- Compare reliability/pricing of known SMS services.<br>- Prototype one method and test SMS receipt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
